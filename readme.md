This project was part of a [datathon](https://sccm.org/Research/Discovery-Research-Network/datascience/Datathon) with Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), which involved coloration with clinicians and pharmacists to develop a data-driven model for care of critically ill patients using large health record databases.

#### Problem Description:

> Are there differences in sedative agent selection in adult patients on invasive mechanical ventilation based on race

#### Databases: 

We used two critical care databases:[ MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/) (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database and the [eICU collborative research database. ](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/about/eicu/)

#### BigQuery and Colab: 

We used [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=sccm-datathon) to easily explore the large datasets using SQL.
